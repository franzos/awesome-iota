## About

*What is IOTA?*

**IOTA** is an open-source, scalable distributed ledger focused on global trade, digital identity, and real-world asset tokenization. In May 2025, IOTA underwent a full protocol rebase — moving from the original Tangle architecture to a **Move VM-based Layer 1** with **Delegated Proof-of-Stake** and **Mysticeti BFT** consensus. The result: 50,000+ TPS, sub-second finality, native smart contracts via the **Move** programming language, and an **EVM-compatible Layer 2**.

The IOTA Foundation is a non-profit based in Germany, focused on building infrastructure for global trade, digital identity, and tokenization of real-world assets.
